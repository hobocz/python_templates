#### A collection of templates for various Python functionality. These scripts were created with:
python 3.10.8, pandas 1.5.1, numpy 1.23.4, matplotlib 3.6.2
They have undergone basic testing in both Windows and Linux systems.

These are simple templates and examples, and are *not meant to display complex
functionality*. They are only meant to be starting points, and to demonstrate
things like coding style and thoroughness.
Some of the functionality represented:
- pandas
- multiprocessing
- pathlib
- docstrings
- type hinting
- decorators
- data classes
- argparse
- logging
- a bit of numpy and matplotlib

PLEASE NOTE: Rigorous testing is still required as there are certainly
some environments, parameters, etc, that were not accommodated and may
uncover issues.
